# [Project 1: E-Commerce Sales Analysis using MySQL]

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Order data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "order_detail.csv" file, containing detailed sales information.
Payment data: The sub-dataset used for this analysis is the "payment_detail.csv" file, containing information about payment methods used in transactions.
Customer data: The sub-dataset used for this analysis is the "customer_detail.csv" file, containing customer IDs and customer registration dates.
SKU (Stock-Keeping Unit): The sub-dataset used for this analysis is the "sku_detail.csv" file, containing detailed product prices and cost details.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Making CTE for combining 4 datasets.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Which month had the highest transaction volume in 2021?
- Which category had the highest transaction volume in 2022?
- How do transaction volumes by category compare between 2021 and 2022?
- What are the five most widely used payment methods?
- What is the ranking of categories based on transaction value?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
--table name with case_1, case_2, case_3, etc

SELECT * FROM case_1;
```
